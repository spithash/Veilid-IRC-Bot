# Veilid IRC Bot
Veilid irc bot written in python. It can read records from the veilid network based on hash and subkey.

** It requires veilid-server to be running locally **

You need to compile pad.c "gcc pad.c -o pad"  
Keep all the files in one directory.

Huge shoutout at epoch@Libera for the bash scripts!  
Find us in #veilid
